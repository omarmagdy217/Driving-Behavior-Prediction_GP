 What is EEG?<br>
===============<br>
<br>
    Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain.<br>
	<br>

</div>


<div>
<a  name="Q2"></a>
<br>
<br>


 How do I get the actual time of a sample?<br>
===========================================<br>
	<br>
	For CSV format:<br>
	REAL TIME =timestamp started (ms)+ TIME_STAMP_s<br>
1000 + TIME_STAMP_ms<br>
<br>

</div>


<div>

<br>
 What is a unit in emotiv?<br>
===========================<br>
<br>
    (As seen in csv)<br>
	units:emotiv<br>
	<br>
	measurement units = one emotiv unit is almost exactly one microvolt.<br>
	<br>

</div>


<div>
<a  name="Q4"></a>
<br>
<br>

 What is the 'recorded' csv format?<br>
============================================<br>
<br>
	recorded:28.07.15 11.14.10<br>
<br>
	[Year]=[Month]=[Day] [Hours].[Minutes].[Seconds]<br>
	<br>
	Note: a session begins (for emotiv csv) when the headset connects to the application, not when a recording begins<br>
	<br>
	For CyKIT / emokit csv, a session begins when the recording begins.<br>
	<br>
<br>
</div>


<div>
<a  name="Q5"></a>
<br>
 What is the 'timestamp started' csv format?<br>
============================================<br>
	<br>
	timestamp started: 2017=07=04T11:55:54.734969+07:00<br>
<br>
	ISO time when the session was started and the timestamps began, to the nearest millisecond.<br>

<br>

 What is an 'RMS voltage value' ?<br>
===================================
<br>
RMS voltage value is a measurement to convert a sinusoidal waveform into the equivelant DC voltage.<br>
Where a sinusoidal wave (AC) would be plotted as alternating between positive and negative, an RMS <br>
value would be a steady straight line, representing the average power(voltage) being produced by <br>
the waveform, in DC format.<br>
<img src="./Images/rms1.gif" /><br>
</div>


<div>
<a  name="Q7"></a>
<br>
<br>
 How do I calculate the 'RMS value' ?<br>
========================================<br>
<br>
Take a sinusoidal wave and split the wave into their respective voltages. They can be spaced as far<br>
as you like, but the closer the segments are to one another. The more accurate the RMS measurement <br>
will be.  Take each wave segments voltage, and multiply it by itself. (ie: squared,  segment_voltage ^ 2)<br>
<br>
Then add each squared segment together. Divide this sum by the total number of segments you have added together.<br>
(ie:  (V^2 + v^2 + V2) / 3)  <br>
<br>
Then find the square root of this sum.  This is your RMS value.<br>
<br>
RMS = SQRT(((V^2 + V^2 + V^2 + V^2) / 4))<br>
</div>


<div>
<a  name="Q8"></a>
<br>
<br>
 What is Full Scale (FS) or Full Scale Deflection (FSD)? <br>
===========================================================<br>
<br>
In electronics and signal processing, full scale or full code represents the maximum current, amperage <br>
or voltage a system can present. The amount the measurement is away from 0, is called the deflection.<br>
    <br>
   </div>


<div>
<a  name="Q9"></a>
    <br>
 What is 'Sampling Rate' ?<br>
=============================<br>
<br>
Sampling rate, is the rate at which data is sent out from the system. <br>
For the EPOC and Insight headsets, this is 128 Hz<br>
Epoc+ can send at either 128Hz or 256Hz. <br>
<br>
<br>
    <br>
  </div>


<div>
<a  name="Q10"></a>
    <br>
 Is it possible to restore 50 and 60hz?<br>
==========================================<br>
<br>
    Yes. With an ‘inverse filter’ function it may be possible to restore some of the signal <br>
    in the 50 and 60Hz zones. Matlab may be required to located and delete mains exclusively.<br>
<br>
    The inverse filter method works. However the dynamic range of the signal is compressed <br>
    because the signal is pushed to a very low value, where the remaining bits are noisy <br>
    with the notch frequencies.  Most of the unfiltered signal can be recovered, with exception<br>
    to 1 or 2 Hz around the mains frequency.  <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
 Does emokit work with all emotiv headsets?<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
    We are currently developing for all headsets.  <br>
<br>

<div>
<a  name="Q12"></a>
<br>
<br>
 What is the 'Mains' ?<br>
=========================<br>
<br>
    Mains harmonic measurement. <br>
    AC power to homes, factories and offices is normally delivered at a frequency of 50 or 60 Hz, <br>
    depending on the region of the world where you live. ... Harmonics are a distortion of the <br>
    normal electrical current waveform.<br>
    <br>
</div>


<div>
<a  name="Q13"></a>
<br>
<br>
 How does the 'Mains harmonic measurement' effect my EEG signal?<br>
===================================================================<br>
<br>
    the 120Hz second harmonic of the 60Hz mains gets folded back into the data as an 8Hz spike <br>
    (100Hz folds back at 28Hz, and so on). You will need a higher=end system and decent screening <br>
    to get meaningful data above 64Hz at this stage.<br>
<br>
</div>


<div>
<a  name="Q14"></a>
<br>
<br>
 How is EEG measured?<br>
========================    <br>
<br>
    EEG is measured in volts. For more precise measurements, microvolts. <br>
    Expressed as: µV (or uV)<br>
    <br>

 What are brain wave rhythms?<br>
================================<br>
    <br>
    There are four distinct periodic rhythms, identified by frequency in Hz (hertz) / or cycles per second. <br>
    also identified by amplitude.  <br>

 Brain Wave Rhythm Descriptions<br>
=================================<br>
    <br>
    Alpha Wave: <br>
    <br>
     Alpha rhythm is the prominent EEG wave pattern of an adult who is awake but relaxed with eyes closed. <br>
     Each region of the brain has a characteristic alpha rhythm but alpha waves of the greatest amplitude <br>
     are recorded from the occipital and parietal regions of the cerebral cortex. <br>
     <br>
     In general, amplitudes of alpha waves diminish when subjects open their eyes and are attentive to <br>
     external stimuli although some subjects trained in relaxation techniques can maintain high alpha <br>
     amplitudes even with their eyes open.<br>
<br>
    Beta: <br>
     <br>
     Beta rhythms occur in individuals who are alert and attentive to external stimuli or exert specific <br>
     mental effort, or paradoxically, beta rhythms also occur during deep sleep, REM (Rapid Eye Movement) <br>
     sleep when the eyes switch back and forth.  This does not mean that there is less electrical activity, <br>
     rather that the “positive” and “negative” activities are starting to counterbalance so that the sum of <br>
     the electrical activity is less.  Thus, instead of getting the wave=like synchronized pattern of alpha <br>
     waves, desynchronization or alpha block occurs.  So, the beta wave represents arousal of the cortex to <br>
     a higher state of alertness or tension.  It may also be associated with “remembering” or retrieving memories.<br>
<br>
    Delta and Theta: <br>
    <br>
     Delta and theta rhythms are low=frequency EEG patterns that increase during sleep in the normal adult.  <br>
     As people move from lighter to deeper stages of sleep (prior to REM sleep), the occurrence of alpha waves <br>
     diminish and is gradually replaced by the lower frequency theta and then delta frequency rhythms.<br>
<br>
     <br>
 Spectrograph <br>
 =============<br>
 Filtering the data to get spectral information requires several steps. <br>
 1. Remove the background offset – use a 0.16Hz high=pass filter or other <br>
 similar background removal method. <br>
 <br>
 2. Pick a sensible sample length – <br>
 a power of 2 is good, containing more than 10 cycles of the lowest frequency of interest, <br>
 so if you want 0.5Hz you need a sample length of 5 seconds (5×128 = 940 samples, so go for<br>
 1024 as the next highest power of 2). <br>
 <br>
 3. Apply a window function which simply multiplies the <br>
 sample by one near the middle, tapering to zero at the ends (Hanning window is a good one). <br>
 <br>
 4. Now calculate your FFT at calculate the POWER within each frequency bin by multiplying the <br>
 FFT with its complex conjugate (generally FFT will return a complex number), then you can add <br>
 up the power bins across each frequency range of interest. Instead of all of this, you can run<br>
 real=time notch filters to pass say 10Hz=13Hz or whatever – but then you need to take the RMS <br>
 value of a specific window to convert to a usable number (actually the square of the RMS value<br>
 is proportional to band power)<br>
<br>
Electrode Positions<br>
=====================<br>
<br>
    Electrode positions have been named according to the brain region below the area of the scalp.<br>
    <br>
    frontal, <br>
    central (sulcus), <br>
    parietal, <br>
    temporal, <br>
    and <br>
    occipital. <br>
    <br>
What is the bipolar method?<br>
=============================<br>
<br>
    In the bipolar method, the EEG is measured from a pair of scalp electrodes. <br>
    The pair of electrodes measures the difference in electrical potential (voltage) <br>
    between their two positions above the brain.  <br>
    <br>
    A third electrode is put on the earlobe as a point of reference, ‘ground’, of the body’s <br>
    baseline voltage due to other electrical activities within the body.<br>
